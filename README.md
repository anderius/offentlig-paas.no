## How to Contribute

You want to contribute? Great!

If you are an owner of this repo, you might want to create a branch to make your changes and create a pull request to merge your branch to master, so you can ask others to have a look. Or, because you are, after all, an owner, you *can* be a lone ranger and just work directly on the master branch.

If you are *not* an owner of this repo, but work in one of the member orgs of Offentlig PaaS Norge and want to contribute, perhaps you should actually be an owner... Make some noise at the **offentlig-paas-no** Slack, and we'll add you.

### Contributing as a Non-Owner of this Repo

You need to fork the repo, make your changes on that fork and then create a pull request in this repo.

Have a look at [this post](https://dev.to/ceri_anne_dev/how-to-fork-and-contribute-to-a-github-repo-5bfp) which explains how to contribute using forks & pull requests - or read [GitHub's recipe for forking](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

When you've created a pull request, one of the admins will have a look at it. They might suggest some changes, otherwise your pull request will be approved & merged and you have successfully contributed to this repo. Thanks! Feel free to pat your own back for being a good person who contributes to offentlig-paas.no :D
